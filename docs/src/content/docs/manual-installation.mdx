import { Tabs, TabItem } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

This guide will walk you through installing and configuring Lunaria in your existing project manually.

:::tip
Follow the [Getting Started guide's "Quick Start" section](/getting-started/#quick-start) for a simplified, CLI-guided set up.
:::

## 1. Add the `@lunariajs/core` package

Lunaria is published through the `@lunariajs/core` package in the npm registry. Add it to your project by running the following command in the project's root directory:

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="npm">

```sh
npm install @lunariajs/core
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="pnpm">

```sh
pnpm install @lunariajs/core
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Yarn">

```sh
yarn add @lunariajs/core
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Then, add the following `lunaria` commands as part of your `package.json`'s `scripts` field:

```json title="package.json" ins={5}
"scripts": {
    "dev": "astro dev",
    "build": "astro build",
    "preview": "astro preview",
    "lunaria:build": "lunaria build",
	"lunaria:preview": "lunaria preview",
}
```

## 2. Create `lunaria.config.json`

Lunaria is configured using `lunaria.config.json`. This file is required so Lunaria knows about your repository structure and what should be tracked.

```json title="lunaria.config.json" mark={2}
{
	"$schema": "./node_modules/@lunariajs/core/config.schema.json"
}
```

:::tip
`@lunariajs/core` comes with a JSON Schema you can refer to with the optional `$schema` property to add IntelliSense support in your code editor.
:::

## 3. Configure the package

Before generating your first localization dashboard, you have to set up the `repository`, `defaultLocale`, and `locales` fields of your `lunaria.config.json` file.

The following example sets up Lunaria to track Markdown/MDX content for both English and Portuguese in a sample project, hosted on `https://github.com/me/cool-project/`:

```json title="lunaria.config.json"
{
	"$schema": "./node_modules/@lunariajs/core/config.schema.json",
	"repository": {
		"name": "me/cool-docs"
	},
	"files": [
		{
			"location": "content/**/*.md",
			"pattern": "content/@lang/@path",
			"type": "universal"
		}
	],
	"defaultLocale": {
		"label": "English",
		"lang": "en"
	},
	"locales": [
		{
			"label": "PortuguÃªs",
			"lang": "pt"
		}
	]
}
```
