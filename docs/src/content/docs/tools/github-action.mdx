import { Tabs, TabItem } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

You can get helpful insights on how pull requests are going to affect the resulting localization status after merging through the Lunaria GitHub Action.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js - `v20.0.0` or higher.
- `@lunariajs/core` - `v0.0.31` or higher.

## Set up the Action

Create a new file in your project at `.github/workflows/lunaria.yml` with the following content, according to the package manager used:

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="npm">

```yml
name: Lunaria

on:
  # Trigger the workflow every time a pull request is opened or synchronized at the target `main` branch
  # Using a different branch name? Replace `main` with your branch’s name
  pull_request_target:
    types: [opened, synchronize]
    branches: [main]

# Allow this job to clone the repository and comment on the pull request
permissions:
  contents: read
  pull-requests: write

jobs:
  lunaria-overview:
    name: Generate Lunaria Overview
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
        with:
          # Necessary for Lunaria to work properly
          # Makes the action clone the entire git history
          fetch-depth: 0

      - name: Setup Node
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: 20
          cache: 'npm'

      - run: npm install

      - name: Generate Lunaria Overview
        uses: yanthomasdev/lunaria-action@main
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="pnpm">

```yml
name: Lunaria

on:
  # Trigger the workflow every time a pull request is opened or synchronized at the target `main` branch
  # Using a different branch name? Replace `main` with your branch’s name
  pull_request_target:
    types: [opened, synchronize]
    branches: [main]

# Allow this job to clone the repository and comment on the pull request
permissions:
  contents: read
  pull-requests: write

jobs:
  lunaria-overview:
    name: Generate Lunaria Overview
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
        with:
          # Necessary for Lunaria to work properly
          # Makes the action clone the entire git history
          fetch-depth: 0

      - name: Setup Node
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: 20
          cache: 'pnpm'

      - name: Setup PNPM
        uses: pnpm/action-setup@v3

      - run: pnpm install

      - name: Generate Lunaria Overview
        uses: yanthomasdev/lunaria-action@main
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Yarn">

```yml
name: Lunaria

on:
  # Trigger the workflow every time a pull request is opened or synchronized at the target `main` branch
  # Using a different branch name? Replace `main` with your branch’s name
  pull_request_target:
    types: [opened, synchronize]
    branches: [main]

# Allow this job to clone the repository and comment on the pull request
permissions:
  contents: read
  pull-requests: write

jobs:
  lunaria-overview:
    name: Generate Lunaria Overview
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
        with:
          # Necessary for Lunaria to work properly
          # Makes the action clone the entire git history
          fetch-depth: 0

      - name: Setup Node
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: 20
          cache: 'yarn'

      - run: yarn install

      - name: Generate Lunaria Overview
        uses: yanthomasdev/lunaria-action@main
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

If everything was set up properly, the Action will now comment on every new, or updated pull request that has files tracked by Lunaria (those who do not, won't receive a comment).

### Run on a private repository

By default, the Action won't run on a private repository for a lack of permissions. To fix this, you will need to make a few changes:

1. Create a new [personal access token (PAT) on GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens#creating-a-personal-access-token-classic) and [add it to your repository's Action secrets](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/using-secrets-in-github-actions#creating-secrets-for-a-repository).

2. Update the following steps on your workflow at `.github/workflows/lunaria.yml`, with the name of the repository secret you created:

   ```yml ins={7}
   - name: Checkout
       uses: actions/checkout@v4
       with:
         # Necessary for Lunaria to work properly
         # Makes the action clone the entire git history
         fetch-depth: 0
         token: ${{ secrets.PAT }}
   ```

   ```yml ins={4}
   - name: Generate Lunaria Overview
     uses: yanthomasdev/lunaria-action@main
     with:
       token: ${{ secrets.PAT }}
   ```

## Reference

### Inputs

- `token` - Optional: a [GitHub personal access token](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens#about-personal-access-tokens) to run the Action with.
