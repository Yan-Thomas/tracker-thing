import { Tabs, TabItem, Steps } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

The Lunaria GitHub Action comments on pull requests with an overview of how the changes made will affect the localization status generated after merging, including insights on possible issues and how Lunaria works.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js - `v20.0.0` or higher.
- `@lunariajs/core` - `v0.0.31` or higher.

## Set up the Action

Create a new file in your project at `.github/workflows/lunaria.yml` with the following content, according to the package manager used:

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="npm">

```yml
name: Lunaria

on:
  # Trigger the workflow every time a pull request is opened or synchronized at the target `main` branch
  # Using a different branch name? Replace `main` with your branch’s name
  pull_request_target:
    types: [opened, synchronize]
    branches: [main]

# Allow this job to clone the repository and comment on the pull request
permissions:
  contents: read
  pull-requests: write

jobs:
  lunaria-overview:
    name: Generate Lunaria Overview
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
        with:
          # Necessary for Lunaria to work properly
          # Makes the action clone the entire git history
          fetch-depth: 0

      - name: Setup Node
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: 20
          cache: npm

      - run: npm install

      - name: Generate Lunaria Overview
        uses: yanthomasdev/lunaria-action@main
```

<TabItem label="pnpm">

        with:

      - name: Setup PNPM
        uses: pnpm/action-setup@v3

      - run: pnpm install

      - name: Generate Lunaria Overview
        uses: yanthomasdev/lunaria-action@main
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Yarn">

```yml
name: Lunaria

on:
  # Trigger the workflow every time a pull request is opened or synchronized at the target `main` branch
  # Using a different branch name? Replace `main` with your branch’s name
  pull_request_target:
    types: [opened, synchronize]
    branches: [main]

# Allow this job to clone the repository and comment on the pull request
permissions:
  contents: read
  pull-requests: write

jobs:
  lunaria-overview:
    name: Generate Lunaria Overview
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
        with:
          # Necessary for Lunaria to work properly
          # Makes the action clone the entire git history
          fetch-depth: 0

      - name: Setup Node
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: 20
          cache: yarn

      - run: yarn install

      - name: Generate Lunaria Overview
        uses: yanthomasdev/lunaria-action@main
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

If everything was set up properly, the Action will now comment on every new, or updated pull request that has files tracked by Lunaria (those who do not, won't receive a comment).

:::tip[Changing the comment's author]
Normally, comments made by the Action will be authored by `github-actions[bot]`. You can change this behavior by [defining a different `token` input](/integrations/github-action/#inputs) in your workflow file, so that the comments will be authored by the user or bot whose the token comes from.
:::

### Additional step for monorepos

By default, the Action will look for the `@lunariajs/core` package within the base directory of your repository.

If you're using a monorepo and the package is not installed in the root `package.json` file, you'll need to set the `working-directory` to the correct path.

This example assumes the `@lunariajs/core` package was installed in the `docs/package.json` file, meaning `working-directory` should be set to `docs`:

```yml ins={4} mark="docs"
- name: Generate Lunaria Overview
  uses: yanthomasdev/lunaria-action@main
  with:
    working-directory: docs
```

### Additional steps for private repositories

By default, the Action won't run on a private repository for a lack of permissions. To fix this, you will need to follow a few additional steps:

<Steps>
1. Create a new [personal access token (PAT) on GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens#creating-a-personal-access-token-classic) and [add it to your repository's Action secrets](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/using-secrets-in-github-actions#creating-secrets-for-a-repository).

2. Add the `token` input to both the Checkout and Lunaria steps of your workflow file at `.github/workflows/lunaria.yml` with the corresponding secret name you added earlier:

   ```yml ins={7} mark="PAT"
   - name: Checkout
       uses: actions/checkout@v4
       with:
         # Necessary for Lunaria to work properly
         # Makes the action clone the entire git history
         fetch-depth: 0
         token: ${{ secrets.PAT }}
   ```

   ```yml ins={4} mark="PAT"
   - name: Generate Lunaria Overview
     uses: yanthomasdev/lunaria-action@main
     with:
       token: ${{ secrets.PAT }}
   ```

</Steps>

## Reference

### Inputs

- `token` - Optional: a [GitHub personal access token](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens#about-personal-access-tokens) to run the Action with.

  ```yml mark={4}
  - name: Generate Lunaria Overview
    uses: yanthomasdev/lunaria-action@main
    with:
      token: ${{ secrets.PAT }}
  ```

- `working-directory` - Optional: a desired working directory for the Action to be run on. Should be set to the subdirectory where `@lunariajs/core` was installed.

  ```yml mark={4}
  - name: Generate Lunaria Overview
    uses: yanthomasdev/lunaria-action@main
    with:
      working-directory: docs
  ```
