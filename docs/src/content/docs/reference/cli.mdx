## Commands

### `lunaria build`

Builds your dashboard and status to disk. By default, the files will be output in `dist/lunaria`, named `index.html` and `status.json` respectively.

#### Options

##### `--skip-status`

The command will skip the status generation and use the latest already available status on disk instead.

This option is recommended when you want to rebuild your dashboard constantly (e.g. to test styling changes) without waiting for the status to be built.

### `lunaria init`

Initializes Lunaria in your project, prompting you with a few questions and setting up a new `lunaria.config.json` file.

### `lunaria preview`

Starts a local server to serve your latest localization dashboard built by [`lunaria build`](#lunaria-build).

This command is not meant for being used in production. For production hosting, see our specific deploy instructions.

#### Options

##### `--port <number>`

Specifies which port to open the preview server on. By default, `3000` will be used if available, if `3000` or your specified port isn't available, a random available port will be used instead.

### `lunaria sync`

Syncs your configuration file's `files`, `defaultLocale`, and/or `locales` fields according to your project's structure.

This command works by analyzing your project's `package.json` for packages Lunaria can infer the configuration, generally from its own configuration file or default content structure.

The currently supported packages in `lunaria sync` are `vitepress` and `@astrojs/starlight`.

#### Options

##### `--package <package>`

Specifies the package you want to sync with, skipping the selection prompt in case several supported packages are found in the same project.

##### `--skip-questions`

Skips all the individual confirmation prompts to changes the `files`, `defaultLocale`, and/or `locales` fields of your configuration.

## Global Options

### `--help`

Prints the help message.

### `--config <path>`

Specifies the path to Lunaria's configuration file relative to the project's root. By default, Lunaria expects a `lunaria.config.json` at the root of the project.

Use this option if you wish to locate your configuration file in other directory or with a different name.
